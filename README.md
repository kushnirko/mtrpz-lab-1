# Simplified Markdown to HTML converter

**This command-line tool takes as input a path to a text file containing simplified Markdown markup and converts it to a fragment of HTML.**

The resulting HTML markup is either printed to [standard output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams) (stdout) or written to the output file if the path to it is specified using the `--out` flag.

The tool also validates Markdown markup for correctness. If errors are encountered, it prints the appropriate message to [standard error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams) (stderr) and exits with a non-zero status code.

## Prerequisites

To use this tool, you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your system.

> [!NOTE] 
> You can install the current long-term support version of Node.js on the platform's official [download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
